# DailyLearner

DailyLearner leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate daily mini-lectures on various software and computer systems topics. The goal is to help you learn something new about technology every single day.

## Example Topics

Here are some sample topics and a preview of what the email will look like:

- [Backpropagation](topics/20241025-Backpropagation%20in%20Neural%20Networks.md)
- [Deadlock Avoidance Techniques](topics/20241025-Deadlock%20Avoidance%20Techniques.md)
- [Shader Programming](topics/20241025-Shader%20Programming%20in%20Graphics.md)
- [WebAssembly](topics/20241025-WebAssembly%3A%20Performance%20and%20Use%20Cases.md)

## How It Works

1. Each day, DailyLearner uses an LLM to create a concise, informative lecture on a specific topic in software engineering or computer science.
2. The generated content is sent via email to subscribers.
3. Topics cover a wide range of subjects, from fundamental concepts to cutting-edge technologies.
