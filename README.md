# DailyLearner

DailyLearner leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate daily mini-lectures on various software and computer systems topics. The goal is to help you learn something new about technology every single day.

## How It Works

1. Each day, DailyLearner uses an LLM to create a concise, informative lecture on a specific topic in software engineering or computer science.
2. The generated content is sent via email to subscribers.
3. Topics cover a wide range of subjects, from fundamental concepts to cutting-edge technologies.

## Example Topics

Here are some sample topics:

- [Backpropagation](topics/backpropagation.md)
- [Deadlock Avoidance Techniques](topics/deadlock-avoidance.md)
- [Shader Programming](topics/shader-programming.md)
- [WebAssembly](topics/webassembly.md)
