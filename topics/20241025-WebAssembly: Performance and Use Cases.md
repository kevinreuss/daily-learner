# WebAssembly: Performance and Use Cases

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format that provides a compact binary format that executes at near-native speed. It works in modern web browsers, providing a secure and efficient format that allows highly performant web applications.

## Performance

WebAssembly's binary format is designed for efficiency in both download and execution. Wasm's byte code is much faster to decode and execute than JavaScript, thus providing a significant performance boost. For instance, a computational task written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly could be up to 20 times faster than JavaScript.

```cpp
// C++ code
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000000; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }
    std::cout << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```javascript
// Equivalent JavaScript code
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 10000000; ++i) {
    sum += i;
}
console.log(sum);
```

## Use Cases

WebAssembly is particularly useful in performance-critical applications such as:

1. **Games**: Wasm enables porting high-performance games to the web without sacrificing performance. Developers can compile their existing game code written in languages such as C++ into WebAssembly and run it in the browser.

2. **Music and Video Editing**: Real-time media manipulation, previously only possible in native applications, can now be done in the browser using WebAssembly.

3. **Scientific Computing**: Wasm allows heavy computational tasks like data visualization and geometry processing to run efficiently in the web browser.

4. **Cryptocurrency**: WebAssembly is used in blockchain platforms for smart contract execution due to its portability and safety features.

In conclusion, WebAssembly offers a significant performance boost compared to JavaScript and is an excellent choice for performance-critical web applications.
